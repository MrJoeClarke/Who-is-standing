His experiences on this trip later encouraged him to become a founder member of the southwest Green Party.\nHe studied at the University of Glamorgan for four years before becoming a comprehensive school teacher in Somerset. He stood as the Green Party parliamentary candidate for Taunton in 1979.\nFollowing a further spell at university in Durham he spent ten years teaching in international schools in southern Africa and Germany. He returned to his home in Carharrack where he has lived with his wife and son for the past 25 years. He works as a science lecturer for Cornwall College and the Open University and was the general election candidate for Camborne and Redruth in 2015. He has served as a parish councillor for Carharrack for four years. In March 2017 he was awarded the Environmental award in the Stars of Cornwall Awards organised by the local newspapers.\nGeoff’s research in vegetational history has made him acutely aware of the massive impact of humans on the landscape and the great responsibility to the planet and future generations this brings. He strongly feels that environmental protection goes hand in hand with social justice and would work hard for a living wage and affordable housing for everyone. He is particularly concerned about the forcing up of property prices and rents by the growth of second homes that remain empty for most of the year.", ""]

He grew up in Leicestershire, went to Medical School in Birmingham and was an A&E Registrar in Leicester before moving to Lincolnshire. The highlights of his career have been getting a £10000 grant from Next to help improve the care of patients with severe sepsis and introducing intranasal diamorphine as a treatment for children in severe pain to Lincolnshire. He is deeply concerned by the lack of beds that results in sick patients being stuck on ambulance trolleys, and the difficulties recruiting A&E doctors to Lincolnshire. He believes that elected politicians could help to address both of these problems, which is why he got into politics. He also helped the University of Lincoln introduce their MSc in Advanced Clinical Practice to train more Advance Nurse Practitioners for Lincolnshire.\nBen lives with his partner and two younger children in Lincoln. Since moving to Lincoln he has been on the YMCA Sleep Easy fundraising event, presented to the Lincoln Eastern Bypass inquiry to try and improve the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, and went to Paris to join the thousands encouraging world leaders to sign the Paris Climate Agreement. He also volunteers in a local community garden with his daughter. He drives a Leaf.\nHe is deeply honoured to be the first Green Party Candidate for Lincoln Borough, and hopes to be able to make the environment a central issue in the debate.", ""]

I have been re-elected 3 times as an independent councillor for College Ward believing that it is important and more effectual if you live in the ward you represent. I set up my own party - People First Party because of a deep distrust of the established Parties, which I feel is a universal view.\nIt was in 2015 that the Green Party's message reached me. They seemed to be the real party of change with radical ideas such as Universal Basic Income, real decentralisation of politics and our economy and a 'people first' rather than 'profits first' solution to some of the profound problems we face, that left me no option but to join them.", ""]

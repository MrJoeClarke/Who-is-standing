His enthusiasm and drive to solve problems, and passion for inspiring and empowering others has allowed him to succeed at the company. It is this passion and willingness to “get the job done” that makes him such a popular candidate and led him to being considered by the Bolton News as a real “one to watch” for 2016’s local elections.", "Because of his passion for the area of Bolton, he has been such a vociferous and vocal campaigner for residents. Tired of seeing local elected officials do as little as possible to fight for the infrastructure and services residents in the area need he decided to join the Bolton Liberal Democrats, and work with them to deliver a better deal for Bolton residents. The lack of interest by Councillors and MPs when bus routes were a risk back in summer 2015 was a turning point. Gathering over 4000 signatures calling for a halt to bus cuts in the local area, he helped to push Arriva and Transport for Greater Manchester into reversing the decision to remove the services entirely, instead ensuring that residents still had some access to public services.", "Since then Warren has been leading the way on a variety of issues in his local area. Working with local residents to fight the Conservative governments programme of fracking, fighting the Labour Councils refusal to put a plan in place to tackle congestion in the town, fighting the Labour Council to return the library back to his local area and keeping residents regularly informed on local issues.", "Warren knows none of the successes would have happened without the fight, drive and passion of local residents who have been supporting him every step of the way. And it’s because of these residents who have shown they are just as passionate about their community as Warren, is the reason why he continues to fight for the changes they desperately deserve.", "It’s clear people in Bolton want a change from the decade of decline under the current Labour Council and are tired by the lack of support and vicious cuts by the Conservative party. And, whatever happens in any election, one thing is certain, there’ll be a Fox in the Bolton ‘Hen Coup’ for a long time to come"],

She came within a few hundred votes of election to Holyrood in 2003.Because of the breadth of her local government experience, Eileen really understands the needs of local constituents and she has fought constantly for fairness and for the least well off in society. She has long battled against the Labour Party's expectation that they would always be in power in Paisley. She was particularly successful in this when the Liberal Democrats joined with the SNP in 2007-12 to run Renfrewshire Council [one of the largest Scottish councils outside the cities]. During this time Eileen held the senior role of Deputy Leader of the council.Eileen has particular experience and knowledge in social work and the arts and heritage of Paisley. Presently she is working hard to ensure that Paisley captures the “City of Culture 2021” title, which will make a huge difference to helping the re-building of Paisley, particularly in relation to jobs and community regeneration. Eileen's qualities include honesty, commitment and being a very hard working politician, reflected in the fact that she has been re-elected many times. In 2014 she was awarded the MBE for her commitment to her local community.She says “I never promise people that I will achieve everything people want – but what I do promise is that I will work as hard as I can for local people to ensure the best possible outcome”."],

Liberal Democrats could do far more in government, given the opportunity to implement the bold, honest, and innovative ideas in their manifesto.", "Martyn is the vice-chair of Westgate-on-Sea Town Council, and enjoys helping to solve problems at the local level (for instance, litter-picking with \"Westgate against rubbish\"!) and making more of Westgate’s amazing history.
